Mortgage Calculator using simple python concepts


I think it would be cool if the interest rates are based on the country you are in, so basically the user is promted to enter his or her country and based on that the calcuation will be made depending on the price of the house the lenght of the repayment. If your reading this either I forgot about it or im too busy learning another language imao (or both most likely)
